Using R-Studio, we can create different types of graphs used for analysis. Down below we have a histogram we created by using the code "hist". Then we used reticulate to have r and python talk to one another as seen below. 
```{r}
hist(quakes$mag)
library(reticulate)
something <- "Using Reticulate"
quakes <- quakes
```

```{python}
dumb="Is Difficult"
print(r.something,dumb)
```
